# hCaptcha Implementation Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented hCaptcha in your Orbit application with the following features:

### üîß What was added:

1. **HCaptcha Import**: Added `import HCaptcha from '@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha'`

2. **State Management**:

   - `captchaToken` state to store the verification token
   - `captcha` ref to control the CAPTCHA component

3. **CAPTCHA Component**: Added HCaptcha widget that:

   - Shows only when user is not logged in with email
   - Automatically matches your theme (dark/light)
   - Provides user feedback on verification/expiration/errors

4. **Integration with Auth**:

   - Anonymous sign-ins now use CAPTCHA token
   - Google OAuth login uses CAPTCHA token
   - CAPTCHA resets after each auth attempt

5. **Environment Setup**: Updated `.env.example` with hCaptcha configuration

## üöÄ Next Steps:

### 1. Set up your hCaptcha site key:

```bash
# Create .env.local file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Add your actual hCaptcha site key
VITE_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_actual_site_key_here
```

### 2. Configure Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security and Protection
3. Enable "CAPTCHA protection"
4. Select "hCaptcha" as provider
5. Enter your hCaptcha **Secret Key** (not the site key!)

### 3. Test the implementation:

1. The dev server is already running at http://localhost:5173/
2. You should see a CAPTCHA challenge when the app loads (if not logged in)
3. Complete the CAPTCHA and you'll get a success message
4. Try logging in with Google - it should use the CAPTCHA token

## üé® UI Features:

- **Adaptive Theme**: CAPTCHA matches your app's dark/light theme
- **Smart Display**: Only shows when needed (anonymous users)
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages for verification/errors
- **Clean Integration**: Styled to match your app's design

## üêõ For Local Testing:

hCaptcha works with localhost out of the box, so you can test immediately. If you need custom local domains:

1. Add them to your hCaptcha site settings
2. Or use ngrok for external testing

The CAPTCHA will protect against abuse while maintaining a smooth user experience for legitimate users.
